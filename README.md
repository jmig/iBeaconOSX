iBeaconOSX
==========

A small app to turn your Mac as an iBeacon, in Swift.

Based on the great work of [Matthew Robinson](https://github.com/mttrb/BeaconOSX) & [http://www.blendedcocoa.com/blog/2013/11/02/mavericks-as-an-ibeacon/](http://www.blendedcocoa.com/blog/2013/11/02/mavericks-as-an-ibeacon/). I strongly recommend to read his article.

**Warning**: You need to have a Bluetooth 4.0 & Mavericks to run the app.
